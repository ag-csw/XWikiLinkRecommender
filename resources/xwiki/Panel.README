Installation Notes
==================

The "CSW Link Panel" is a ready-to-run extension to the XWiki system. For installing and activating it, proceed as described below.


PREREQUISITES:
--------------

- You need to be able to log in to your XWiki as an administrator.
- You need to be able to modify files inside your XWiki installation directory on the server (the ability to log in as a user with write privileges in the XWiki installation folder).


Installation:
------------- 

1. Import the panel into your XWiki database:

	a. Login to your XWiki as an administrator.
	b. Navigate to "Administration" -> "Import".
	
	c. In the section "Add an attachment" at the lower end of the import page, choose as "File to upload" the file Panels.CSW+Link+Panel.xar
	d. Click "Attach this file".
	e. The uploaded file should now be available in the section "Available files to import" at the upper end of the import page. Click on it.
	f. A new section "Available documents to import" should become visible. Leave the checkboxes as they are and click "Import".
	
	g. repeat the steps c. through f. with the file Panels.CSW+Link+Javascript.xar and Panels.CSW+Link+Popup+Javascript.xar
	

2. Activate the panel:

	a. Locate your XWiki installation directory (which we will call <xwiki install dir> now).
	
	b. Navigate to the directory <xwiki install dir>/webapps/xwiki/templates.
	c. Open the file editpanelsvars.vm in a text editor.
	d. Replace the line:
		#set($editorPanelsWysiwyg = "Panels.DocumentInformation,Panels.EditTranslations,Panels.SyntaxHelp")
	   with:
	   	#set($editorPanelsWysiwyg = "Panels.DocumentInformation,Panels.CSW Link Panel,Panels.EditTranslations,Panels.SyntaxHelp")
	e. Save the file and quit the text editor.

3. (Alternative to 2.):

    a. make a copy of the file webapps/xwiki/templates/editpanelsvars.vm in a temporary directory
       (do not change the filename)
    b. Apply the changes from step 2d. to the copied version of editpanelsvars.vm
    c. Log in to XWiki as Admin and navigate to the page XWiki.DefaultSkin 
       (or whatever your active skin is; XWiki.DefaultSkin is the default)
    d. Upload the modified copy of editpanelsvars.vm as attachment to that page
